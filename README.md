# onion-am3935
#


This is a python library written to run on the Onion Omega2 series of IOT boards
to interface with AMS' AM3935 consumer-grade lightning detector chips via
I2S.

It uses Onion's Python I2C Library, based on Onion's user-space I2C C library.

The code is based on both the AdaFruit Arduino library for the same, as well as
<Insert person here/>'s raspberry Pi library.

Enjoy
